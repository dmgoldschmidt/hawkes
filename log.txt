Ok, I'm restarting logging, which I should have been doing all along,
but whatever.

I've just finished getting hawkes.jl into some sort of
shape with simulated data, and I'm now doing mods to read Cindy
wsa data.  This involves building flowsets, so I'm writing "get_flowsets.jl".
It will read a raw wsa file and scan it for "triggers" which are enips talking
to rare webips.  I have a file of rare webips, which I convert to a julia
dictionary: "rare_webips.jld2" if that doesn't exist already, or load it
if it does exist. For each raw wsa record, I read the enip and check a dictionary fts_flowsets = Dict{String,Flowset} keyed on enip to see if enip in flowsets. If it's not in fts_flowsets, and the corresponding wbip is rare, I start a new
Flowset and dictionary entry.  Flowset is a struct which has members
(enip, start_time, and data = Array{HawkesPoint}).  For now, HawkesPoint
is a struct with members (time, wbip).  Later I might add more stuff.
So if the enip just read is in fts_flowsets, I check to see if the current
time is < start_time + 240.  If it is, I push a new HawkesPoint to data.
Otherwise, I ignore it and continue reading the raw wsa file.
